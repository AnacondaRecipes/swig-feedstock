  summary: C/C++ parser code generator
  description: |
    SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++
    with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It works by
    taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to
    generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the
    underlying C/C++ code. In addition, SWIG provides a variety of
    customization features that let you tailor the wrapping process to suit
    your application.
